                    <h3> What is Allergie</h3>
                    <p>
                        Allergie / Allergy is an immune system reaction to substances unfamiliar to it, such as pollen
                        grains, poison from bee stings or animal dander.

                        The immune system produces a protein called antibody (or: antibody - Antibody .IgE). These
                        antibodies protect the body from unwanted foreign bodies, which may invade the body and cause
                        disease or infection. When a person suffers from allergic reactions to a specific substance, his
                        immune system produces antibodies that identify the allergen (the allergen, which causes
                        allergen) and treats it as a harmful element, although it is not, which leads to the release of
                        histamine and substances. Others cause allergy symptoms.

                        Allergic reactions can cause various symptoms that may appear on the skin, in the sinuses, in
                        the respiratory airways and in the digestive system. The severity of the sensitivity and the
                        degree of severity of the sensitivity differ from one person to another, as the sensitivity can
                        range from slight stimulation to anaphylaxis, an emergency that may cause death. The allergy
                        cannot be fully cured, but there are some treatments that help relieve allergy symptoms.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Symptoms of Allergie</h3>

                    <p>
                        Symptoms of allergies differ in the same allergy, from one person to another. Symptoms of
                        allergies may appear in the respiratory airways, in the sinuses and nasal passages, in the skin
                        and in the digestive system.

                        In most cases, the allergic reaction is a nuisance and distress, but the symptoms of allergies
                        are mild. As for reactions in case of acute allergies, they may be more dangerous, because they
                        may affect many organs and systems in the body. For more severe allergies, an allergic reaction
                        can cause death. This phenomenon is known as anaphylaxis - a response to severe allergies with
                        hypersensitivity to proteins or other substances that lead to severe respiratory and circulatory
                        / vascular disorders.

                        Hay fever (also called hay fever), also called allergic rhinitis, can cause:
                        Nasal congestion, itching
                        Runny nose
                        Watery or swelling in the eyes (conjunctivitis - Conjunctivitis).
                        Atopic Dermatitis, also known as Eczema, may cause:

                        Itchy skin
                        Skin redness
                        Skin scaling
                        Food Allergy may cause:

                        Feeling pinched in the mouth
                        Swelling of the lips, tongue, face or throat
                        Urticaria (Urticaria)
                        Anaphylaxis.
                        Allergy to insect stings may cause:

                        Swelling in a wide area (Edema) around the site of the sting
                        Itching or urticaria throughout the body
                        Coughing, chest contractions, crackling and wheezing, or Shortness of breath
                        Anaphylaxis.
                        Drug Allergy may cause:

                        Urticaria
                        Itching
                        Skin rash
                        Facial swelling
                        Gobbling and wheezing at the time
                        Anaphylaxis.
                        Anaphylaxis

                        Some types of allergies, including food allergies and insect stings, may cause a dangerous
                        phenomenon known as anaphylaxis. This allergy may end in death and requires immediate medical
                        treatment. This sensitivity affects many parts of the body and its systems and may cause a shock
                        (Shock).

                        Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include:

                        Syncope (or: unconsciousness)
                        Dizziness
                        Severe shortness of breath
                        Rapid and weak flickering
                        Skin rash
                        Nausea and vomiting (Emesis / Vomiting)
                        Airway respiratory distention, which may stop breathing completely.
                        In the event of an acute allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), urgent medical treatment should be
                        directed immediately.

                        If an injection of adrenaline (also called: Epinephrine) is available for self-injection, it
                        should be used immediately. Even if the symptoms improve after the adrenaline injection,
                        however, you should go to the emergency department to ensure that the symptoms do not reappear,
                        once the injection is done.

                    <h3> Causes and risk factors for Allergie</h3>
                    <p>
                        An allergy occurs due to a fault in the immune system when it identifies a non-harmful substance
                        as a dangerous invasive force. In this case, the immune system produces antibodies that are
                        constantly on standby and prepared to fight the allergen. When the body is again being
                        allergenic, the antibodies stimulate the release of a number of immune system chemicals, such as
                        histamine, that cause allergic symptoms.

                        Common allergens include:

                        Airborne allergens, such as: pollen grains, animal dander, dust mites and mold.
                        Some foods, especially nuts, nuts, wheat, soybeans, fish, shellfish, eggs and milk.
                        Poison from insects, such as bee stings or wasps stings.
                        Some medicines, especially penicillin or some penicillin-based antibiotics (Penicillin).
                        Natural rubber (milky juice secreted by some plants - Latex) or other substances whose contact
                        can provoke allergic reactions in the skin.
                        The risk of allergies increases for people belonging to one of the following groups:

                        They have a Family History of Asthma. The risk of developing allergies increases among relatives
                        of patients who suffer from asthma or allergies, such as: hay fever, urticaria or eczema.
                        Children - Although allergies may appear at any age, children are more susceptible than adults
                        to allergies. Sometimes the sensitivity in children increases as they get older. However, in
                        many cases, the allergy disappears and then returns later in the future.
                        Asthma patients or people with allergies - the likelihood of developing allergies is greater for
                        asthma patients, and people who suffer from a specific type of allergy are at risk of having an
                        allergy to other substances, too.

                    <h3> Complications of Allergie </h3>
                    <p>
                        Allergies increase your risk of exposure to other health problems, including:

                        Anaphylaxis - a person who suffers from acute allergic reactions is more likely to develop
                        anaphylaxis, which is a reaction that results from the characteristics of an allergy.
                        Anaphylaxis is mainly associated with nutritional sensitivity and sensitivity to insect toxins.
                        Other allergy - People with one type of allergy are more likely to develop other types of
                        allergies.
                        Asthma - People with asthma - a reaction by the immune system that affects the airways and
                        breathing - is more likely to develop allergies. Asthma often occurs as a result of exposure to
                        a allergen in the environment (asthma caused by allergies).
                        Atopic dermatitis (eczema), sinusitis, and ear or lung infections - the risk of developing these
                        diseases increases in people with hay fever (hay fever), from animal allergy or from mold
                        allergy.
                        Fungal infections in the sinuses or lungs - the risk of these two diseases, known as fungal
                        sinusitis and Aspergillosis, increases in people who are allergic to mold.
                    </p>
