                        <h3> What is epilepsy</h3>
                        Epilepsy is a defect in the transmission of electrical badges within the brain. Although the
                        common belief is that epilepsy always causes a fit of involuntary movement and loss of
                        consciousness, in reality, epilepsy appears in very varied forms. Cases in which signs known as
                        seizures appear are often implicit, provoking strange feelings, increased sensitivity, and
                        irregular behavior. Some people with epilepsy stare into space for a while when they have a
                        seizure, while others suffer from severe seizures and cramps.

                        One in every 100 people in the United States suffered, during his lifetime, an inexplicable
                        epileptic seizure. However, a one-time epileptic seizure does not constitute an indication of
                        the presence of epilepsy. Many people, children who suffer a lot from fever, for example, may
                        have a one-time epileptic seizure. But if the situation recurs and a person suffers from two
                        epileptic seizures, the probability of experiencing another third seizure rises very seriously.
                        At least two epileptic seizures are needed in order to diagnose epilepsy.

                        Epilepsy, in general, appears in childhood or in adults over 65 years of age. However, epilepsy
                        may appear at any age. Treating the correct and appropriate epilepsy can help prevent epileptic
                        seizures, or at least reduce the frequency and severity of their occurrence. Indeed, many
                        children and boys with epilepsy recover and recover from adulthood.

                <div>
                    <h3> Symptoms of epilepsy</h3>

                    <p> Epilepsy is caused by erratic brain cell activity, so epileptic seizures may cause harm to any
                        body work that is coordinated by the brain. An seizure may cause temporary confusion, complete
                        loss of consciousness, staring in space or involuntary shivering movements in the hands and
                        feet.

                        The signs and manifestations of epileptic seizures vary according to their type. In most cases,
                        if a person suffers from frequent epileptic seizures, he tends to develop the same signs and
                        symptoms in each seizure, so that the signs accompanying the seizure become the same from one
                        seizure to another. However, there are other patients who suffer from different types of
                        seizures, the signs and symptoms of which vary from time to time.

                        Generally, doctors tend to classify seizures as partial or general, according to the picture in
                        which the irregular activity in the brain has started. If the seizure appears as a result of
                        irregular activity in only one part of the brain, this is a Partial seizure or Focal seizure.
                        The seizure, during which there is an irregular activity in all parts of the brain, is called a
                        general seizure. In some cases, the seizure may start in some part of the brain and then
                        transfer to all parts of the brain. </p>

                    <h3> Causes and risk factors for epilepsy</h3>
                    <p> Certain types of epilepsy can be attributed to a defect in the genes responsible for the way the
                        brain cells communicate with each other, but it is well known that only rare types of the
                        disease are caused by certain impaired genes. Moreover, it appears that the disorder of any
                        group of hundreds of genes can be a central factor in the emergence and development of epilepsy.
                        Although it appears that certain types of epilepsy are transmitted from one generation to
                        another, the genetic genetic factors constitute only one of the factors that can cause the
                        emergence of epilepsy, and may be due to the fact that some people tend to be affected, more
                        Others, by environmental factors that can lead to seizures.

                        An epileptic seizure may occur, in many cases, as a result of an accident, illness or medical
                        shock, for example a stroke that causes brain damage or prevents oxygen from reaching the brain.
                        In rare cases, the cause of epilepsy may be a tumor in the brain. In all cases, not all
                        epileptic seizures are caused by one specific factor that can be diagnosed and identified. This
                        applies to about half of people with epilepsy.

                        Among the risk factors:

                        Family history
                        Head injuries
                        Stroke or other diseases of the blood vessels
                        Contaminated brain diseases, such as meningitis and persistent convulsions and tremors during
                        childhood, due to high fever and fever.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3> Epilepsy complications</h3>
                    <p>
                        If a person fails and stumbles the moment he develops an epileptic seizure, he may receive a
                        blow to his head, and a person with an epileptic attack is likely to be drowned while swimming
                        or bathing in the bathtub.

                        An epileptic seizure that leads to loss of consciousness or loss of control may be very serious
                        if it occurs while driving or while operating machinery. Medicines designed to suppress seizures
                        may cause drowsiness, which may limit the ability to drive. In many US states, there are
                        restrictions in driving licenses, depending on the ability of the person with epilepsy to
                        suppress seizures.

                        Epileptic seizures in a pregnant woman pose a threat to the fetus and to the mother alike,
                        knowing that a number of drugs approved to treat epileptic seizures increase the risk of the
                        fetus having congenital malformations. Therefore, if a woman has epilepsy and wants to become
                        pregnant, she should consult with the attending physician.

                        Most women with epilepsy are able to get pregnant and give birth to healthy children, but they
                        may be required to change the therapeutic dose of drugs and have to undergo constant and close
                        monitoring and control throughout pregnancy. It is very important to coordinate and consult with
                        the attending physician about planning pregnancy.

                        The emergence of complications that are dangerous to life is not a common occurrence in this
                        disease, but the risks exist. People who have severe, persistent and prolonged seizures are at
                        constant risk of permanent brain damage and even death risk. People who suffer from epileptic
                        seizures, especially those who are not subject to permanent monitoring, may die suddenly and
                        idiopathically, as a result of an epileptic seizure.

                        The risk of sudden and idiopathic death as a result of an epileptic seizure increases if:

                        Epileptic seizures have started at a very early age
                        Epileptic seizures involving more than one part of the brain.
                        Epileptic seizures persist despite taking drug therapy.
