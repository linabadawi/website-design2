                    <h3> What is Parkinson's Disease</h3>
                    <p>
                        Parkinson is a disease that appears gradually. It often begins with an almost imperceptible and
                        invisible tremor in one hand. And while the emergence of flickering is the most obvious
                        distinguishing feature of Parkinson's disease, the syndrome generally slows or freezes movement
                        as well. Friends and family members can observe the immobility of facial features that are
                        unable to express and that the arms do not move on either side of the body when walking. Often,
                        the speech becomes more fluffy with the complement.

                        The symptoms of Parkinson's disease worsen as the disease progresses more.

                        Although Parkinson's disease cannot be cured, many types of medications to treat Parkinson's can
                        help relieve symptoms. In certain cases, surgical treatments may be required
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h3> Symptoms of Parkinson's disease</h3>

                    <p> The symptoms that accompany Parkinson's disease vary from person to person. The initial symptoms
                        may be only implicit, without being noticeable for many months, and even for many years.
                        Symptoms begin to appear, first, on one side of the body, and are always more severe and
                        dangerous on this same side, in the future.

                        Symptoms of Parkinson's disease include:

                        Tremor / shivering: the characteristic tremor (tremor) that accompanies Parkinson's disease
                        often begins in one hand. They appear as thumb rubbing with the index finger with frequent
                        movement, forward and backward, also called "pill-tremor tremor". This is the most common
                        symptom. However, a large proportion of Parkinson's patients do not have a noticeable strong
                        shiver.
                        Slow motion (Bradykinesia): Over time, Parkinson's disease may limit the patient's ability to
                        perform movements and voluntary actions, which may make daily activities easier and simpler
                        complex tasks and require a longer period of time. When walking, the patient's steps may become
                        shorter and less heavy, his feet dragged, or the feet may freeze in place, which makes it
                        difficult for him to start with the first step.
                        Muscular rigidity: Muscular rigidity often appears at the extremities and in the scruff area
                        (back of the neck). Sometimes deafness is so severe that it restricts the range of movement and
                        is accompanied by severe pain.
                        Upright erection and imbalance: The stature of a Parkinson's patient may become convex due to
                        illness. He may also suffer from an imbalance, a common symptom in Parkinson's patients,
                        although it is generally mild to even the most advanced stages of the disease.
                        Loss of involuntary movement: blinking, smiling and moving hands when walking - are involuntary
                        movements, an integral part of being a human being. However, these movements appear in
                        Parkinson's patients at a lower frequency, and sometimes even disappear. Some Parkinson's
                        patients may have a frozen look, without the ability to blink, while others may appear without
                        any expressive movements or they may sound, and hear, artificial (artificial) when they speak.
                        Speech changes: The majority of Parkinson's patients have difficulty speaking. The words of the
                        Parkinson's patient may become softer, monotonic, monotonous, and may "swallow" part of the
                        words from time to time or he may repeat words he has said before, or he may become hesitant
                        when he wants to speak.
                        Dementia: In the advanced stages of the disease, some Parkinson's patients have memory problems
                        and partially lose their mental clarity. In this regard, medications used to treat Alzheimer's
                        Disease may help reduce some of these symptoms to a more moderate degree.

                    <h3> Causes and risk factors for Parkinson's disease</h3>
                    <p>
                        The vast majority of Parkinson's symptoms are caused by a deficiency of a chemical transporter
                        in the brain called dopamine. This occurs when certain cells in the brain die or are atrophied,
                        which is responsible for the production of dopamine. However, the researchers do not know for
                        sure or definitively, so far, the first and primary factor that causes this series of
                        operations. Some researchers believe that genetic changes, or environmental toxins, have an
                        impact on the appearance of Parkinson's disease.
                        Risk factors for Parkinson's disease include:

                        Age: young adults rarely develop Parkinson's. Parkinson's disease appears in general,
                        middle-aged and middle-aged, and with age, more and more, the degree of risk of developing
                        Parkinson's also increases.
                        Heredity: If the family has one or more relatives with Parkinson's disease, the risk of
                        developing Parkinson's disease increases, although this possibility does not exceed 5%.
                        Recently, evidence has been found to demonstrate the existence of a whole network of genes
                        responsible for programming the brain’s structure and function.
                        Gender: Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's than women.
                        Exposure to Toxins: Continuous exposure to herbicide and insecticide increases slightly the risk
                        of developing Parkinson's.

                    <h3> Parkinson's disease complications</h3>
                    <p>
                        Parkinson's disease is often accompanied by additional problems, including:

                        - Depression

                        - Sleep disorders

                        Problems chewing or swallowing

                        Trouble urinating

                        Constipation

                        Sexual performance problems

                        Some medications intended to treat Parkinson's may cause a number of complications and
                        complications, including: tremors or shaking in the arms or legs, hallucination, hypotension and
                        a sharp drop in blood pressure when the position changes from sitting to standing.
