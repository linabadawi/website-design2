                        <h3> What is Alzheimer's</h3>
                        Alzheimer's (also called: presenile dementia) is the most common cause of dementia. It damages
                        mental and social skills, which impedes daily performance in normal life. Alzheimer's disease is
                        atrophy of healthy brain cells that leads to a continuous decline in memory and mental /
                        intellectual abilities.

                        Alzheimer's is not a normal stage of aging, but the risk of developing it increases with age.
                        About 5% of people between the ages of 65 and 74 suffer from Alzheimer's disease, while the
                        percentage of people with Alzheimer's disease among people age 85 and older reaches about 50%.

                        Although Alzheimer's is an incurable disease, there are treatments that may improve the quality
                        of life for those who suffer from it. Patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as the people
                        they care for, need the support of family and friends in order to successfully fight
                        Alzheimer's.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3> Symptoms of Alzheimer</h3>

                    <p> In the first stage of Alzheimer's, there is a slight loss of memory and instances of confusion
                        and confusion, which ultimately leads to irreversible and irreversible damage to the patient's
                        mental abilities, and also destroys his ability to recall, to logical thinking, to learning and
                        to imagine.

                         memory loss:
                        Everyone finds it difficult to remember a few things. It's normal to forget where to put your
                        car keys, or the names of people you rarely meet. But in Alzheimer's patients with memory
                        problems are exacerbated much.

                        People with Alzheimer's disease face the following problems:

                         They repeat the same sentences and words
                        They forget conversations or dates
                        They put things in the wrong place, and in places that are totally illogical
                        They forget the names of their family members and the names of items they use daily
                        Problems with abstract thinking
                        At the beginning of the disease, Alzheimer's patients may not be able to maintain their
                        financial budget, a problem that may develop into difficulty in knowing, identifying, and
                        dealing with numbers.
                        Difficulty finding the right or appropriate word
                        The ability to find the right word, or even follow a conversation, sometimes becomes a serious,
                        and even a challenging, task for Alzheimer's patients. In the end, their ability to read and
                        write also weakens
                        Problems with the ability to determine the location
                        Loss of time, even Alzheimer's patients may "get lost" in a familiar and familiar area
                        Loss of judgment and attitude
                        Difficulties solving daily problems, such as knowing how to act in the event of food burning in
                        the oven. With time it becomes more difficult and ultimately it becomes impossible. Alzheimer's
                        disease is very difficult to carry out tasks and actions that require planning, decision-making,
                        ability to govern and take a position
                        Difficulty carrying out usual and known tasks and tasks.
                        It is very difficult to perform routine tasks that involve a few stages or steps, such as
                        cooking. People with Alzheimer's disease in its advanced stages finally forget how to do the
                        most basic things.

                        Alzheimer's patients have personality changes, such as:

                        Moody moody
                        Lack of confidence in others
                        Increased stubbornness
                        Social introvertedness
                        Depression
                        the fear
                        Aggressive</p>

                </div>

                    <h3> Causes and risk factors for Alzheimer</h3>
                    <p> Alzheimer's is not the result of just one factor. Scientists believe that Alzheimer's disease is
                        caused by a combination of genetic and other factors related to lifestyle and the surrounding
                        environment. It is very difficult to understand the causes and factors of Alzheimer's, but its
                        effect on brain cells is clear, as it affects brain cells and eliminates them.

                        There are two common types of neuron damage (neurons) in Alzheimer's patients:

                        Plaques: accumulation of a protein, usually harmless, called Amyloid beta, can cause damage in
                        the process of communication between brain cells. The main cause of neuronal destruction in
                        Alzheimer's is still unknown, but there is ample evidence that an abnormally accumulating
                        amyloid-beta protein is the cause.

                        Tangles: the internal structure of cerebral cells depends on the proper and normal functioning
                        of a protein called Tau protein. In Alzheimer's patients, changes in the fibers of Tau protein
                        lead to twisting and wrapping. Many researchers believe that this phenomenon may cause
                        significant and serious damage to nerve cells (neurons), and even eliminate them.

                        Age: Alzheimer's disease usually appears over the age of 65, but it can appear, in very rare
                        cases, even before the age of 40. The prevalence of the disease among people aged 65-74 years is
                        less than 5%. Among those aged 85 years and older, the prevalence of Alzheimer's is about 50%.

                        Genetic factors: If the family has Alzheimer's patients, then the possibility of first-degree
                        family members (sons / daughters, siblings / sisters) is slightly higher. The genetic mechanisms
                        for the transmission of Alzheimer's disease among members of the same family have not yet been
                        fully identified, but scientists are noticing a few genetic mutations that increase the risk of
                        infection in certain families.

                        Gender: Women are more likely than men to develop Alzheimer's disease. One of the reasons for
                        this is that women live more years.

                        Simple cognitive defects: People with mild cognitive defects have more serious memory problems
                        than are acceptable and usual in their age, but not serious enough to define them as dementia.
                        Many people with these defects develop Alzheimer's disease at some point.

                        Lifestyle:
                        Factors that increase the risk of heart disease also increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's
                        disease. of between it:

                        hypertension
                        Hypercholesterolemia
                        Unbalanced diabetes
                         Maintaining high physical fitness is not the only task - the brain should be trained as well.
                        Some research and studies confirm that maintaining mental activity throughout life, especially
                        at an advanced age, reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

                        Educational-cultural level: Studies have found a relationship between the low-level education
                        and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. But the exact reason for this is unknown. Some
                        researchers believe that the more we use our brain, the more areas of contact and contact
                        between the neurons, which make up the largest reserves in old age, will be created. However, it
                        may be difficult in the first place to notice Alzheimer's disease in people who keep their
                        brains permanently.</p>

                    <h3> Alzheimer complications</h3>
                    <p>
                        In an advanced stage of Alzheimer's, patients lose the ability to care for themselves.

                        This fact may result in other medical problems such as:

                        Pneumonia: Difficulty swallowing food and fluids. These may cause inhalation of some food and
                        drinks in the air passages and lungs, which can lead to inflammation of the lungs.

                        Infections: Due to the lack of control of the urine, it is sometimes necessary to use a
                        catheter, which increases the risk of urinary tract infections. These infections, if not treated
                        properly, may lead to more serious infections, which may eventually lead to death.

                        Fall injuries: Alzheimer's patients with confusion and confusion are more likely to fall. This
                        may lead to fractures, in addition to falling as a common cause of severe head injuries, such as
                        bleeding in the brain.
