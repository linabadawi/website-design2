                    <h3> What is High Blood Pressure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some people experience high blood pressure for years without feeling any symptom. High and
                        uncontrolled blood pressure increases the risk of serious health problems, such as a heart
                        attack and stroke.

                        High blood pressure often develops over many years, and ultimately it appears in almost all
                        people.

                        Fortunately, the disease is very easy to detect, so control of it is possible with the help of
                        doctors.

                    <h3> Symptoms of High Blood Pressure</h3>

                    <p>
                        The symptoms of high blood pressure do not appear in most people who suffer from it, and also in
                        cases where high blood pressure records values that are dangerous to their formation.

                        In some patients, the following symptoms appear:

                        Mild headaches
                        Dizziness
                        Or excessive bleeding from the nose.
                        But these symptoms and signs usually appear when the disease reaches a more advanced stage, to
                        the extent that it poses a life threat.

                    <h3> Causes and risk factors for High Blood Pressure</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are two types of hypertension:

                        <h5>Primary hypertension (major):</h5> In 90% - 95% of cases in adults, the cause cannot be
                        identified.
                        This species tends to evolve gradually, over several years.
                        <h5> Secondary hypertension:</h5> At the remaining 5% - 10%, this type is born as a result of
                        another
                        disease, usually suddenly appearing and causing blood pressure higher than that of the primary.
                        <ul>
                            Several diseases and medications are among the most important causes of secondary
                            hypertension,
                            among them:

                            <li> Kidney disease</li>
                            <li> Adrenal gland tumors</li>
                            <li> Certain birth defects in the heart</li>
                            <li> Certain medications such as: birth control pills, anti-cold drugs, decongestants</li>
                            <li> Painkillers without a prescription and a number of prescription drugs</li>
                            <li> Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine (Amphetamine).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6> Risk factors</h6>
                        There are several factors that increase your risk of developing high blood pressure,
                        some of
                        which cannot be controlled, which include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h6> Age:</h6> The risk of developing the disease increases with age. At the beginning
                                of middle
                                age, the
                            </li>
                            disease is more common among men. As for women, they tend to develop the disease in the
                            postmenopausal period (Menopause)
                            <li>
                                <h6> Family history:</h6> Hypertension tends to be genetically transmitted.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Other additional controllable risk factors:
                        It is represented in:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h6>Obesity: </h6>The higher the human being, the more blood he needs to be able to
                                deliver
                                oxygen and
                                nutrients to the various tissues of the body. The greater the amount of blood flowing
                                into the
                                blood vessels, the greater the pressure on the arterial walls.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6> Lack of physical activity:</h6> the frequency of cardiac work is higher for people
                                without
                                physical
                                activity than for those who do it. The faster the heart works, the more effort the heart
                                needs
                                to make at each contraction, which increases pressure on the arteries. In addition, lack
                                of
                                physical activity increases the risk of obesity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6> Smoking:</h6> Smoking tobacco raises blood pressure in an immediate and temporary
                                manner. In
                                addition, chemicals in tobacco may damage artery walls. As a result, the arteries may
                                become
                                narrower, which leads to high blood pressure.
                            </li>
                            <ul </ul> <h6> Too much salt (sodium):</h6> The presence of a very large amount of table
                                salt (sodium) in
                                the diet
                                may lead to fluid retention in the body, which causes high blood pressure.
                                <li>
                                    <h6> Low-potassium nutrition:</h6> Potassium helps balance the sodium level in
                                    cells. When a
                                    sufficient
                                    amount of potassium is not consumed or stored, this may lead to the accumulation of
                                    a
                                    very large
                                    amount of sodium in the blood.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h6> Low-vitamin D nutrition:</h6> It is unclear whether a lack of vitamin D can
                                    cause high blood
                                    pressure, or not. Researchers believe that vitamin D can affect an enzyme produced
                                    by
                                    the
                                    kidneys and affect blood pressure.

                                    <h6> Drinking alcohol:</h6> consuming alcohol may cause hormones that lead to high
                                    blood pressure
                                    and an

                                    <h6> Tension: </h6>High levels of tension lead to a temporary, but dramatic, rise.
                                    Attempts to
                                    relax by
                                    eating a lot, smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol, may complicate blood pressure
                                    problems.

                                    and
                                    kidney disease) may increase your risk of developing high blood pressure.

                            </ul>
                            Sometimes pregnancy is a factor affecting high blood pressure.

                            Mainly, hypertension is common among adults, but children may also be at risk of
                            developing it,
                            sometimes.

                            In some children, hypertension develops as a result of kidney or heart problems. But a
                            large and
                            growing number of children are at risk of developing high blood pressure as a result of
                            bad life
                            habits, such as improper and unhealthy nutrition and lack of physical activity.

                    <p>
                        Excess blood pressure on the arterial walls, may cause damage to blood vessels and other parts
                        of the body. The higher the blood pressure, the higher and the longer it remains untreated for a
                        longer period of time, the greater the damage.
                          Failure to treat high blood pressure may lead to:
