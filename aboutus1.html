                        The Ministry of Health was established in 1921, and in 1926 the first law was issued to regulate
                        health affairs, and this situation continued until 1939, when the Health Department of the
                        Ministry of Interior joined until an independent Ministry of Health was established in 1950
                        under the name of the Ministry of Health. In 1966, the Public Health Law No. (43) was issued,
                        and it was amended according to the Public Health Law (No. 21 of 1971). The latter was amended
                        several times until the Public Health Law No. (47 of 2008) was issued whereby the Ministry
                        regulates health matters in the Kingdom.

                        During the past forty years, Jordan has witnessed a comprehensive health renaissance, during
                        which it has achieved great achievements in various medical fields, despite the severe
                        conditions experienced by it and the suffering of the Palestinian Nakba in 1948 and 1967 and its
